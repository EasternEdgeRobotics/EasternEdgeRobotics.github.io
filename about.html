	Eastern Edge Robotics is the internationally competing Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) team from 
	Memorial University of Newfoundland. Each year since its foundation in 2002, 
	the team has designed, constructed and operated a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) 
	to meet specifications set by the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE)
	Center to model real-world ocean-workplace scenarios.
</p>

<p>
	Competition requires more than an ROV capable of performing a set of
	intensive tasks. The team must create an engaging poster display
	showcasing the vehicle, a technical report explaining design decisions
	and evidence of teamwork, and formally present the result of a year's
	worth of hard work to a panel of professionals.
</p>

<p>
	Eastern Edge's members are post-secondary students from
	various backgrounds including ROV technology, several engineering
	disciplines, computer science, graphic arts and ocean instrumentation.
</p>

<p>
	Some of Eastern Edge's greatest achievements include
	three first place overall trophies, as well as several first place wins in the
	engineering panel, technical report and poster display categories. The
	team has competed in incredible venues including NASAâ€™s Neutral Buoyancy
	Lab in Houston, Texas, and the world's largest flume tank at home in St.
	John's, Newfoundland.
</p>
<p>
	Last year, when the competition was hosted by Memorial University, Eastern Edge 
	was awarded Second Place overall. We are excited to announce that the 2016 MATE 
	international ROV competition is being held June 23-25 at the NASA Johnson 
	Space Center's Neutral Buoyancy Lab in Houston, Texas, USA.
