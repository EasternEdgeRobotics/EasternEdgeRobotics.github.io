		4 bags lost, but all members here! We made it to Houston at around 10am local time. We got our bearings and some tacos (really huge tacos), then made our way to the hotel. The bags arrived after a trip to a Super Walmart, but we found a couple items were broken. Next step: fix things!

		Today the ROV went in the water for the first time in the USA. We went to Chili's and ran trhough our presentation as a group for the first time! Our Pilot, Keely, won the Game of Life at Chili's.

		Panic! After a small electrical mishap, we lost one of our cameras. Another was prepared to replace it, and a spare was ordered to keep our redundancy. Everything should be fine come our first run!

		Today the presentation is locked in a room practicing, and the rest of the team is preparing the ROV to go back in the pool. Lots of printing is being done, and we are really appreciating our mentors for all the driving they are doing for us (we like coffee)!
