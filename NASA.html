<div class="text">
	<p>
		4 bags lost, but all members here! We made it to Houston at around 10am local time. We got our bearings and some tacos (really huge tacos), then made our way to the hotel. The bags arrived after a trip to a Super Walmart, but we found a couple items were broken. Next step: fix things!

		Today the ROV went in the water for the first time in the USA. We went to Chili's and ran trhough our presentation as a group for the first time! Our Pilot, Keely, won the Game of Life at Chili's.

		Panic! After a small electrical mishap, we lost one of our cameras. Another was prepared to replace it, and a spare was ordered to keep our redundancy. Everything should be fine come our first run!

		Today the presentation is locked in a room practicing, and the rest of the team is preparing the ROV to go back in the pool. Lots of printing is being done, and we are really appreciating our mentors for all the driving they are doing for us (we like coffee)! We went to a great Texas BBQ restaurant for supper.

	Houston Trip Day 5: <!--Wednesday-->

<div class="text">
	<p>
		Today we got to go to NASA's Johnson Space Center. This experience was incredible, and many team members would replace any person we saw working in the NASA buildings (resumes available on request, NASA). The Saturn V made some team members tear up, and for a few hours we barely noticed the incredible heat! The poster is being reprinted after some issues with the first print job. The presentation team is practicing over and over and everything seems great! Cameras are ready again, and sensors are being worked on in preparation for missions.

	Houston Trip Day 6: <!--Thursday-->

<div class="text">
	<p>
		Today was a big day. Opening ceremonies brought us to NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab. The pool is so impressive, and there are a lot of people here. After opening ceremonies we had a safety check, small test in the NBL, and our presentation! We got the clear on safety, and the sales presentation went very well. Seeing the ISS mockup in the pool from the presentation windows was breathtaking, and the deck team will be even closer tomorrow! Time for some last minute touches for tomorrow.

	Houston Trip Day 7: <!--Friday-->
</div>
<div class="text">
	<p>
		The first runs were today, and we had a score of 150. We found that there were bad latency problems with the cameras in the rippling pool! Our poster also went up with all of the other posters. They all looked great! Before fixing our cameras, we went to the second pool where the Chinese teams were doing their mission runs. We met some awesome people, and learned a lot about the HKUST ROV (Epoxsea) team's ROV ORCA! A really cool ROV. After this we worked on cameras all night for our second and final run.

		Our second run had a score of 215! Our amazing deck crew did an amazing job, especially amazing pilot Keely! She pulled off an amazing move in the last few seconds to give us this score. Following this, we helped get ORCA to the bottom of the NBL to show it could withstand the 12 metre depths. The Hong Kong ROV team Epoxsea from HKUST achieved a great score of 185 in the hot pool yesterday. Following this, the team went to Pleasure Pier to unwind before closing ceremonies. The ceremonies allowed us to talk to teams we had met along the way, and we are proud to say Eastern Edge Robotics did very well. Racheal Seymour won an award for being a presentation MVP and the team won the gROVer award for courtesy, kindness, and professionalism to other teams. EER also won first for product demonstration (our 215 score for mission runs!), and finally first overall! It was an amazing experience, and we were so happy to compete in the MATE International ROV Competition 2016. Thank you to NASA, MATE, our sponsors, and especially our wonderful mentors.
