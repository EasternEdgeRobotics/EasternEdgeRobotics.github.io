		After moving halfway across the country to start my post-secondary education, I joined EER thisyear without knowing anything about underwater vehicles. Being a first year in the Remotely Operated Vehicle Technician program, I was eager to obtain experience that would help me with my studies. Through EER I have learned valuable skills such as patience, communication, and problem solving. Previously having no experience in mechanical, software, electrical, payload, or piloting, senior mentors were eager to help me learn. Piloting was intimidating, but through practice and tool evolution, my piloting techniques have improved. Collaboration with other team members on the tool design process has allowed me to contribute to the ROVâ€™s payload from a piloting perspective. My knowledge of the components inside ROVs has also improved; even with smaller scale vehicles, the same concepts are applied to work class vehicles, greatly helping my studies.
