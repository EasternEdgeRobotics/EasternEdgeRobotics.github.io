	Eastern Edge Robotics is the internationally competing ROV team from the
	Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland.
	Each year since its foundation in 2002, the team designs, constructs and
	operates a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to meet specifications set by
	the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center to model
	real-world ocean-workplace scenarios.
</p>
<p>
	Competition requires more than an ROV capable of performing a set of
	intensive tasks. The team must create an engaging poster display
	showcasing the vehicle, a technical report explaining design decisions
	and evidence of teamwork, and formally present the result of a year’s
	worth of hard work to a panel of professionals.
</p>
<p>
	The twenty to thirty team members are post-secondary students from
	various backgrounds including ROV technology, several engineering
	disciplines, computer science, graphic arts and ocean instrumentation.
</p>
<p>
	Some of the team’s greatest achievements from its long history include
	three first place overall trophies and several first place wins in the
	engineering panel, technical report and poster display categories. The
	team has competed in incredible venues including NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy
	Lab in Houston, Texas, and the world’s largest flume tank at home in St.
	John’s, Newfoundland.
